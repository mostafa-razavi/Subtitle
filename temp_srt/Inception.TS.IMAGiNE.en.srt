1
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,153
Hey! Come here!
We have a man on the shore!

2
00:01:14,156 --> 00:01:15,709
I'm on my way.

3
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:24,757
He was hallucinating,
but he mentioned your name...

4
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,228
Show him

5
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:33,132
He only had this with him...

6
00:01:34,483 --> 00:01:36,036
And this.

7
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:58,346
Are you here to kill me?

8
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,387
I know what this is.

9
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,426
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

10
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,596
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

11
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:26,923
A man possessed of some radical notions.

12
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:36,676
What is the most resilient parasite?
Bacteria? A virus?

13
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,248
An intestinal worm?

14
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:44,006
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...
- An idea.

15
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,821
Resilient. Highly contagious.

16
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:51,010
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

17
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:55,069
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood that sticks.

18
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:58,616
- Right in there somewhere.
- For someone like you to steal?

19
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:01,464
Yes. In the dream state, your
conscious defense is lowered

20
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:05,414
and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft.
It's called extraction.

21
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,982
Sir Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from even

22
00:03:08,984 --> 00:03:12,501
- the most skilled extractor.
- How can I do that?

23
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:15,726
Cause I am the most skilled extractor.

24
00:03:15,746 --> 00:03:18,035
I know how to search your
mind and find your secrets.

25
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,065
I know the tricks. And I can teach them
to you so even when you're asleep

26
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:25,141
your defense is never down.

27
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:29,133
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

28
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,866
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife

29
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,361
better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

30
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:37,942
If this is a dream and you
have a safe full of secrets

31
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:40,241
I need to know what's in that safe.

32
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:44,670
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

33
00:03:46,474 --> 00:03:51,239
Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.
But I'll consider your proposal.

34
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,437
He knows.

35
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,011
What's going on up there?

36
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,580
Saito knows.
He's playing with us.

37
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:56,112
It doesn't matter.
I can get it here. Trust me.

38
00:04:56,114 --> 00:05:00,382
The information is in the safe.
He looked right at it when I mentioned "secrets".

39
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,610
What's she doing here?

40
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,539
Just head back to the room, alright.
I'll take care of this.

41
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,552
Okay, make sure you do.
We're here to work.

42
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:22,242
If I jump, would I survive?

43
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:28,430
A clean dive, perhaps.
Mal, what are you doing here?

44
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:31,107
I thought you might be missing me.

45
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:36,093
You know that I am.
But I can't trust you anymore.

46
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:38,755
So what?

47
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,050
Looks like Arthur's taste.

48
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,358
Actually, the subject is partial
disposal of British painters.

49
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:49,693
Please, have a seat.

50
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,686
Tell me...
Did the two kids miss me?

51
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:05,802
You can't imagine.

52
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:13,859
- What are you doing?
- Getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal.

53
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,276
Goddamn it.

54
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:32,632
- Turn around.
- Put the gun down.

55
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:41,871
Please.

56
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,767
Now, the envelope Mr. Cobb.

57
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,354
Did she tell you?
Have you known all along?

58
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,970
That you're here to steal from me
or that we are actually asleep?

59
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,814
I want to know the
name of your employer.

60
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,985
There's no use in threatening
within a dream right, Mal ?

61
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,150
That depends on what you're threatening.
Killing him will just wake him up.

62
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,404
But pain...

63
00:08:26,284 --> 00:08:32,440
Pain is in the mind and judging by
the decor we're in your mind right, Arthur?

64
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,789
- What are you doing? It's too soon!
- I know. But the dream has collapsed.

65
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,807
Just try to keep Saito lie a little bit longer.
We're almost there.

66
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,174
This place.
The paintings.

67
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:23,027
Stop him!

68
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:49,700
I think that's gonna work.
Wake him up!

69
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,509
You awake!

70
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,417
- Give him the kick!
- What?

71
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,177
Drop him.

72
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,027
He's up.

73
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:09,668
You came prepared, hmm?

74
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,995
Not even my head of security
knows this apartment.

75
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,160
How did you find it?

76
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:17,411
It's very difficult for a man of your position
to keep a love nest like this secret

77
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,997
particularly when there's a
married woman involved.

78
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:22,650
- She will never...
- Yet, here we are.

79
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,516
- For the dilemma.
- They're getting closer.

80
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,235
- You got what you need.
- Well, it's not true.

81
00:11:28,237 --> 00:11:30,785
You left out a key piece
of information, didn't you?

82
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,027
You held something back because
you knew what we were up to.

83
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:36,174
Question is why do
you let us in at all?

84
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:38,840
- An audition.
- An audition for what?

85
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:41,063
Doesn't matter.
You failed.

86
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:43,822
We extracted every bit of
information you had in there.

87
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:46,271
But your dream approach is obvious.

88
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,462
So leave me alone.

89
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,593
You don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito.
The operation that hired us...

90
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:36,096
they won't accept failure.
We won't last two days.

91
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,180
Cobb?

92
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,488
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this a little more simply.

93
00:12:42,606 --> 00:12:46,165
Tell us what you know!
Tell us what you know, now!

94
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,274
I've always hated this carpet.

95
00:12:52,587 --> 00:13:01,668
It stain and fade in such distinctive ways.
That way you know it's made of wool.

96
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,102
But now...

97
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,684
...a line of polyester.

98
00:13:10,314 --> 00:13:15,269
Which means I'm not lying on
my carpet in my apartment.

99
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:21,815
You have lived after your reputation, Mr. Cobb.
I'm still dreaming.

100
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:30,794
- Where did he go?
- We're not getting paid.

101
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:38,888
Dream within a dream, huh.
I'm impressed.

102
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:43,450
But in my dream,
you play by my rules.

103
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:46,881
- Yes, but you see Mr. Saito...
- We're not in your dream.

104
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,552
We're in mine.

105
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,186
Asshole.
How did you mess up the carpet?

106
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,597
- It wasn't my fault.
- You're the architect.

107
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,004
- I don't know he's gonna rub his damn cheek on it!
- That's enough.

108
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:10,275
- You, what the hell is all that?
- I have it under control.

109
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,952
I didn't see it under control.

110
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:15,636
We don't have time for this.
I'm getting off at Kyoto.

111
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,815
Why?
We still have to check every compartment.

112
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:20,157
I don't like trains.
Listen.

113
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,022
Every man for himself.

114
00:15:33,234 --> 00:15:35,334
- Yes, hello.
- Hi, daddy.

115
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:37,281
<i>Hi, dad..</i>

116
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:40,746
Hey guys, hey.
How are you? How are you doing, huh?

117
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,903
<i>Good.
- Okay, I guess.</i>

118
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:51,005
- Okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James?
- Yeah, when are you coming home, dad?

119
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:54,392
Well, I can't sweetheart. I can't.

120
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,794
- It's not for a while, remember?
- Why?

121
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,108
I told you, I'm away
because I'm working, right?

122
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,746
Grandma says you're
never coming back.

123
00:16:06,995 --> 00:16:11,680
Phillipa, is that you?
Put grandma on the phone for me, will you?

124
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:14,764
She's shaking her head.

125
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:18,318
Let's just hope she's wrong about that.

126
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,770
- Daddy?
- Yeah, James ?

127
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:24,307
<i>Is Mommy with you?</i>

128
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,650
James, we've talked about this.
Mommy's not here anymore.

129
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:34,940
<i>Where?</i>

130
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,029
<i>That's enough, kids.
Say bye bye..</i>

131
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:41,410
Listen, I wanna send some
presents with grandpa, alright?

132
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:44,341
And you be good,, you be...

133
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:54,495
- Our ride's on the roof.
- Alright.

134
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:04,533
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

135
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:07,683
- Why?
- Locked down in a dream, Mal showing up.

136
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,388
Sorry about your leg,
it won't happen again.

137
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,721
It's getting worse, isn't it?

138
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,984
One apology is all
you're getting huh, Arthur.

139
00:17:14,035 --> 00:17:16,666
- Where's Nash ?
- He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?

140
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,866
No, we're supposed to go over Saito's
expansion plans in Cobol Engineering

141
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:23,907
two hours ago. By now, they know we failed.
It's time we disappear.

142
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,887
- Where would you even go?
- Buenos Aires.

143
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:30,294
I'll cut my load, I may slip out a
job when things quiet down.

144
00:17:30,698 --> 00:17:32,567
- You?
- States, sir.

145
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:35,411
Send my regards.

146
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:44,385
He sold the art. Fell off the company
and bargained for his life.

147
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:48,938
So I offer you the satisfaction.

148
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,238
It's not the way I deal with things.

149
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:08,001
- What will you do with him?
- Nothing.

150
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,595
But I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.

151
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:27,991
- What do you want from us?
- Inception.

152
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,542
- Is it possible?
- Of course not.

153
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:35,571
If you can steal an idea from someone's mind
why can't you plant one idea instead.

154
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:38,761
Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.
I say to you...

155
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,440
"Don't think about elephants".

156
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:42,234
- What are you thinking about?
- Elephants.

157
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:45,564
Right. But it's not your idea
because you know I gave it to you.

158
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,792
The subject's mind can always
trace the genesis of the idea.

159
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:52,041
- True inspiration's impossible to fake.
- It's not true.

160
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,125
- Can you do it?
- Are you offering me a choice?

161
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,927
Cause I can find my own
way to square things with Cobol.

162
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:04,165
- You don't need to have a choice.
- And I choose to leave, sir.

163
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:12,002
Tell the crew where you want to go.

164
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,231
Hey, Mr. Cobb!

165
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,547
How would you like to go home?
To America ?

166
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,205
- To your children?
- Can't fix that!

167
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:30,454
- No one can!
- Just like inception.

168
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,344
Cobb, come on.

169
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,402
How complex is the idea?

170
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:39,711
- Simple enough.
- No idea is simple...

171
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,362
when you need to plant it
in somebody else's mind.

172
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:45,788
My main competitor is an
old man in poor health

173
00:19:45,904 --> 00:19:50,060
His son will soon inherit
control of the corporation.

174
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,013
I need him to decide to
break up his father's empire.

175
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:58,363
- Cobb, we should walk away from this.
- Hold on.

176
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,083
If I were to do this...If I even could do it
I need a guarantee

177
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:05,956
How do I know you can deliver?

178
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:07,794
You don't

179
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:14,195
But I can.
So, do you want to take a leap of faith?

180
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:21,194
Or become an old man filled
with regrets, waiting to die alone?

181
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,384
Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb.
And choose your people more wisely.

182
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,146
Look, I know how much
you wanna go home.

183
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,557
- But this can't be done.
- Yes, it can.

184
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,436
- You just have to go deep enough.
- You don't know that.

185
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,558
I've done it before.

186
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:54,036
Who'd you do it to?

187
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,204
Are we going to Paris?

188
00:21:00,945 --> 00:21:03,922
We're gonna need a new architect.

189
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,563
You never did like your office, did you?

190
00:21:22,487 --> 00:21:25,635
No space to think in
that room covered.

191
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:29,775
Is it safe for you to be here?

192
00:21:30,691 --> 00:21:34,578
Extradition between France and the United States
is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.

193
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,574
I think they might find a way
to make it work in your case

194
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:42,294
Look, I..brought this for you to give
to the kids when you have a chance.

195
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,171
It will take more than the
occasional stuffed animal

196
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:47,905
to convince those children
they still have a father.

197
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:49,194
I'm just doing what I know.

198
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:52,739
- I'm doing what you taught me.
- I never taught you to be a thief.

199
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,189
No, you taught me to navigate people's
minds but after what happened

200
00:21:56,305 --> 00:22:00,252
They wanna hold our legitimate
ways for me to use that skill.

201
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:07,517
What are you doing here, Dom?

202
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,284
I think I found a way home.

203
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,155
It's a job for some very very
powerful people.

204
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,615
People who I believe can
fix my charges permanently..

205
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:23,600
- But I need your help.
- You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.

206
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,879
You know what I'm offering.
You have to let them decide for themselves.

207
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:31,008
- Money.
- Not just money. You remember. It's...

208
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:35,400
the chance to build cathedrals,
entire cities, things that never existed.

209
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:38,180
Things that couldn't exist in the real world.

210
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,425
So, you want me to let someone
else follow you into your fantasy.

211
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:47,169
They don't actually come in to the dream.
They just design the levels...

212
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:48,625
and teach them to the dreamers.
That's all.

213
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:52,031
Design it yourself.

214
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:55,535
Mal won't let me.

215
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:04,364
Come back to reality, Dom.
Please.

216
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,837
Those kids, your grandchildren-
they're waiting for their father to come back home.

217
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:16,514
That's their reality. And this job,
this last job that's how I get there.

218
00:23:16,635 --> 00:23:19,870
I would not be standing here
if I knew any other way.

219
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:26,325
I need an architect
who's as good as I was.

220
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:33,502
I got somebody better.
Ariadne?

221
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:38,155
I'd like you to meet, Mr. Cobb.

222
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,582
- Please to meet you.
- If you have a few moments...

223
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:44,225
Mr. Cobb has a job offer
he'd like to discuss with you.

224
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,888
- Is the work pretty soon?
- Not exactly.

225
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:51,061
- I have a test for you.
- You're not gonna tell me anything about this first?

226
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:53,868
Before I describe the job,
I have to know you can do it.

227
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:57,346
- Why?
- It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

228
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:05,088
Two minutes, design a maze
that it takes one minute to solve.

229
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:08,193
Stop.

230
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,340
Again.

231
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:14,666
Stop.

232
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:20,075
You have to do better than that.

233
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,370
That's more like it.

234
00:24:52,153 --> 00:24:56,486
They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true
potential. Now, that's when we're awake.

235
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,831
When we're asleep, the mind
can do almost anything.

236
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,463
- Such as?
- Well, imagine you're designing a building, right?

237
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:04,810
You consciously create each aspect.

238
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,317
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself. If you know what I mean.

239
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:12,874
- Yeah, yeah. Like, uhmm, discovering.
- Genuine inspiration, right?

240
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,017
Now in a dream, our mind
continuously does this. We...

241
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:21,342
create and perceive our world simultaneously.

242
00:25:21,344 --> 00:25:22,782
And our mind does this so well

243
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:24,717
that we don't even know it's happening.

244
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:27,620
That allows us to get right
into the middle of that process.

245
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,039
- How?
- By taking over the creating part.

246
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,876
Now, this is where I need you.
You create the world of the dream.

247
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:36,247
We bring the subject into that dream.

248
00:25:36,249 --> 00:25:38,796
And they feel it's their subconscious.

249
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,908
How can I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality.

250
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:47,260
Well, dreams they feel
real while we're in them, right?

251
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,864
It's only when we wake up that we realize
something was actually strange.

252
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,966
Let me ask you a question. You never really
remember the beginning of a dream, do you?

253
00:25:57,017 --> 00:26:00,092
You always wind up right in
the middle of what's going on.

254
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:03,211
- I guess, yeah.
- So how did we end up here?

255
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:07,023
- Well, we just came from the...
- Think about it, Ariadne.

256
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:10,606
How did you get here?
Where are you right now?

257
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:18,164
- We're dreaming?
- You're actually in the middle of
the workshop right now, sleeping.

258
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,413
And this is your first lesson in
shared dreaming, so there you go.

259
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:59,729
If it's just a dream
then why are you...

260
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:02,782
It's never just a dream, is it?
When your face is full of glass

261
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,612
feels like hell.
When you're in it, it feels real.

262
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,442
It's what the military developed.
During that time, it was a training program

263
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:11,959
for soldiers to shoot and stab and
strangle each other and then wake up?

264
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,689
How did architects think they belong?

265
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,923
Well, someone had to
design the dreams, right?

266
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:21,423
- Why don't you give us another five minutes?
- Five minutes?

267
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,671
We were talking for like at least an hour.

268
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:28,185
In a dream, your mind functions
more quickly therefore...

269
00:27:28,217 --> 00:27:30,723
time seems to feel more slow.

270
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:33,374
Five minutes in the world
gives you an hour in the dream.

271
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,998
Why don't we see what you
can get up to in five minutes?

272
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:46,375
We got the basic layout.
Bookstore, cafe.

273
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,792
Almost everything else is here to.

274
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:51,211
- Who are the people?
- Projections of my subconscious.

275
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,652
- Yours?
- Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer.

276
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:57,451
You built this world. I am the
subject, my mind populates it.

277
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,697
You can literally talk
to my subconscious.

278
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,953
That's one of the ways we extract
information from a subject.

279
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:05,326
- How else do you do it?
- By creating something secure, like a...

280
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:07,987
like a bank vault or a jail.

281
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,570
The mind automatically fills it with
information it's trying to protect.

282
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,011
- Understand?
- Then you break in and steal it.

283
00:28:14,698 --> 00:28:15,829
Well...

284
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:21,372
I guess I thought that the dream space should
be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.

285
00:28:21,874 --> 00:28:25,700
My question is, what happens when you
start messing with the physics of it all?

286
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:08,917
- Something, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

287
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,318
Why are they all looking at me?

288
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:37,800
Cause my subconscious feels that
someone else is creating this world.

289
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,266
The more you change things,
the quicker the projections

290
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:42,015
start to converge them.

291
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,882
- Converge?
- It sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.

292
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,966
They attack like white blood
cells fighting an infection.

293
00:29:48,018 --> 00:29:51,965
- Are they going to attack us?
- No. Just you.

294
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,043
This is great but I'm telling you,
if you keep changing things like this...

295
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,859
Jesus. Mind telling your
subconscious to take it easy?

296
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:09,622
It's my subconscious.
Remember, I can't control it.

297
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,621
Very impressive.

298
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:17,229
I know this bridge.
This place is real, isn't it?

299
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:19,331
Yeah, I cross it everyday
to get to the college.

300
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:21,262
Never recreate places from your memory.

301
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,138
Always imagine new places.

302
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,793
Well, you gotta draft from
stuff you know, right?

303
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:27,807
Only use details.
A street lamp or a phone booth.

304
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,576
- Never entire areas.
- Why not?

305
00:31:29,863 --> 00:31:32,481
Because building a dream from
your memory is the easiest way

306
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,730
to lose your grasp from what's
real and what is a dream.

307
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:36,007
Is that what happened to you?

308
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,142
Listen to me.
This has nothing to do with me, understand?

309
00:31:38,405 --> 00:31:40,166
Is that why you need me
to build your dreams?

310
00:31:40,889 --> 00:31:43,133
Get off of her.
Back up.

311
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,419
- Back up!
- Cobb!

312
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,854
- Get off me!
- Let me go!

313
00:31:46,876 --> 00:31:48,277
- Don't! Mal!
- Cobb!

314
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:49,507
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

315
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:50,841
- Mal!
- Wake me up!

316
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,880
- Mal, No! No!
- Wake me up!

317
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,506
Mal, no!

318
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,371
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You're okay.

319
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:01,340
- You're okay.
- Why...why wouldn't I wake up?

320
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:05,197
Cause there were still some time on the
clock and you can't wake up within a dream

321
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:06,192
unless you die.

322
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,474
- Show me the totem.
- What?

323
00:32:08,112 --> 00:32:11,652
- A totem, it's a small, personal...
- That's some subconscious you got on you, Cobb!

324
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:15,514
- She's a real charmer.
- Oh I see, you met Mrs. Cobb.

325
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,104
- She's his wife.
- Yeah. So, a totem.

326
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:22,300
You need a small object to potentially have you...
something you have all the time.

327
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:23,182
that no one else knows.

328
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,621
- Like a coin?
- No. It must be more unique than that.

329
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:28,589
This is a loaded die.

330
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,398
I can't let you touch it.
That would defeat the purpose.

331
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:36,915
Only I, know the balance and the
weight of this particular loaded die.

332
00:32:36,972 --> 00:32:39,246
That way, when you
look at your totem,

333
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:41,512
You know beyond a doubt
that you're not in someone else's dream.

334
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,657
I don't know if you can't see what's
going on or if you just don't want to

335
00:32:50,223 --> 00:32:53,016
but Cobb has some serious problems
that he's trying to bury down there.

336
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:56,728
And I'm not about to just open
my mind to someone like that.

337
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,572
She'll be back. I've never seen anyone
pick it up that quickly before.

338
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:09,912
Reality is not gonna be enough for her now.
And when she comes back...

339
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,917
If she comes back, you're gonna
have her building mazes.

340
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:15,927
- Where are you gonna be?
- I gotta go visit Eames.

341
00:33:16,503 --> 00:33:19,610
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa.
It's Cobol's backyard.

342
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:22,427
- It's a necessary risk.
- There is plenty of good thieves.

343
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:26,893
We don't just need a thief.
We need a forger.

344
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,107
You can rub them together all you want,
but they're not gonna breed.

345
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:40,674
- You'll never know.
- Let me get you a drink.

346
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:44,723
You might.

347
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,462
- Your spelling hasn't improved.
- Test me.

348
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,368
How's your handwriting?

349
00:33:55,755 --> 00:33:57,116
- The best in town.
- Good.

350
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:58,719
Thank you very much.

351
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:00,150
Inception.

352
00:34:00,724 --> 00:34:04,150
Now, before you bother
telling me it's impossible...

353
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,223
No, it's perfectly possible.
It's just bloody difficult.

354
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:10,897
- Interesting.
- So Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.

355
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,831
Arthur...
You still work with that stick and mind?

356
00:34:14,006 --> 00:34:17,734
- He's good at what he does, right?
- Oh, he's the best. He has no imagination.

357
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:18,590
Not like you.

358
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,368
Listen, if you're gonna perform
inception you need imagination.

359
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:25,103
Let me ask you something.
Have you done it before?

360
00:34:25,695 --> 00:34:29,090
We tried it. We got the idea in
place. But it didn't take.

361
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:31,718
- You didn't plant it deep enough?
- No, it's not just about depth.

362
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:35,485
You need the simplest version
of the idea in order for it...

363
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:37,583
to grow naturally in your subjects.
Mind is a very subtle art.

364
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:40,894
So what is this idea that you need to plant?

365
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:44,616
We need the heir of a major corporation
to dissolve his father's empire.

366
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:48,888
Well. you see right there, you have various political
motivations and anti-manipulistic sentiments to set forth.

367
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:53,377
And with all that stuff, it's really
at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.

368
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:57,002
And what you have to do is
start with the absolute basic.

369
00:34:57,243 --> 00:35:00,639
- Which is what?
- The relationship with the father.

370
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:05,062
- Do you have a chemist?
- No, not yet.

371
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:11,548
Alright, well there is a man here. Yusuf.
He formulate his own versions of the compounds.

372
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:13,851
- When are you taking me there?
- Once you lost your tail.

373
00:35:14,591 --> 00:35:16,845
- Men at the bar.
- Cobol Engineering.

374
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:19,700
That price on my head,
was that dead or alive?

375
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:22,013
I don't remember.
Let's see if they start shooting.

376
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:25,190
Run interference. I'll meet you downstairs
in the bar in, say, in half an hour.

377
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:28,076
- Be back here?
- It's the last place they'd suspect.

378
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:31,031
Alright.

379
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:36,434
Freddy ! Freddy Simmons.
My God, it's you, isn't it?

380
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,686
- Who?
- No, it isn't.

381
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:42,614
You're not dreaming now, are you?

382
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:01,691
Stay out!

383
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:22,238
No, cafe.
One cafe.

384
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,492
Cafe.

385
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:31,198
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

386
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:36,116
- What are you doing in Mombasa?
- I need to protect my investments.

387
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:41,493
Ah, so this is your idea
of losing your tail, huh.

388
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,869
Different tail.

389
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:52,574
Cobb said you'd be back.

390
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:57,291
- I tried not to come, but...
- But there's nothing quite like it.

391
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:01,475
It's just... pure creation.

392
00:38:02,226 --> 00:38:06,245
Shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture?
You're gonna have to master a few tricks

393
00:38:06,296 --> 00:38:08,308
if you're gonna build three
complete dream levels.

394
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:11,290
- Excuse me.
- What kind of tricks?

395
00:38:11,651 --> 00:38:14,548
In a dream, you can cheat
architecture into impossible shapes.

396
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:18,930
That lets you create closed loops.
Like the Penrose Steps.

397
00:38:19,332 --> 00:38:21,097
Infinite staircase.

398
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:27,012
See?

399
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:35,178
Paradox. So a closed loop like that will help you
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

400
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:37,657
How big do these levels have to be?

401
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:40,687
It could be anything from the
floor of a building to an entire city.

402
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:42,477
But they have to be complicated enough...

403
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:44,094
that we can hide from the projection.

404
00:38:44,145 --> 00:38:45,640
- A maze.
- Right, a maze.

405
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:48,068
- And the better the maze...
- Then the longer we have...

406
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,582
- ...before the projections catch us?
- Exactly.

407
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,623
My subconscious
seems quiet enough.

408
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:54,930
You wait till it turns ugly.

409
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,938
No one likes to feel someone else
is messing around with their mind.

410
00:38:58,543 --> 00:39:00,310
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

411
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,945
I don't know if he can't,
but he won't.

412
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:06,541
He thinks it's safer if
he doesn't know the layouts.

413
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,501
- Why?
- He won't tell me.

414
00:39:08,516 --> 00:39:10,191
But I think it's Mal.

415
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,639
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

416
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,068
- They're still together?
- No, she's...

417
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,953
She's dead.

418
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,423
What you're seeing there
is just his projection of her.

419
00:39:26,453 --> 00:39:29,601
- What was she like in real life?
- She's lovely.

420
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,685
- You are seeking a chemist?
- Yes.

421
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:37,551
To formulate compounds for a job?

422
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:42,440
- And to go into the field with us.
- No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

423
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:46,332
We'd need you there to tell the
compounds specific to our needs.

424
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:48,633
- Which are?
- Great depth.

425
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:51,146
A dream within a dream?
Two levels?

426
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,316
Three.

427
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:59,064
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

428
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:05,605
- It is possible you just had to have a sedative.
- Well, powerful sedative.

429
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:09,163
- How many team members?
- Five

430
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:10,497
Six.

431
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:16,259
The only way to know you've
done the job is if I am with you.

432
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,167
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

433
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,319
This time, it seems there is.

434
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,007
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it everyday.

435
00:40:26,606 --> 00:40:28,614
- What for?
- Yeah, I'll show you.

436
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:37,955
- Perhaps you will not want to see.
- After you.

437
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:50,554
Six, ten, twelve.
All connected, bloody animal.

438
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,092
They come everyday to share the dream.

439
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:56,898
You see?
Very stable.

440
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:06,642
- How long do they dream for?
- Three, four hours, each day.

441
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:09,634
- And the dream time?
- With this compound?

442
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:13,101
- About forty hours, each and every day.
- Why do they do it?

443
00:41:13,186 --> 00:41:14,192
Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

444
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:19,399
After a while it becomes the
only way you can dream.

445
00:41:19,448 --> 00:41:21,531
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

446
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:24,293
- They come here everyday to sleep?
- No.

447
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:32,194
They come to be woken up.
The dream has become their reality.

448
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,620
Who are you to say otherwise, huh?

449
00:41:38,506 --> 00:41:39,767
Let's see what you can do.

450
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,792
You know how to find me.

451
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,872
You know what you have to do.

452
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:02,830
Sharp enough?

453
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,725
Are you alright, Mr. Cobb?

454
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,662
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just fine.

455
00:42:32,387 --> 00:42:36,317
Robert Fischer, heir to the
Fischer-Morrow energy conglomerate.

456
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:38,182
What's your problem
with this Mr. Fischer?

457
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,216
That's not your concern.

458
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:44,002
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

459
00:42:44,586 --> 00:42:49,316
You asked me for inception. I do hope you
understand the gravity of that request.

460
00:42:50,003 --> 00:42:53,624
The seed that we plant in this
man's mind will grow into an idea.

461
00:42:53,678 --> 00:42:56,715
This idea will define him.
It may come to change...

462
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:59,568
It may come to change
everything about him.

463
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:03,348
We're the last company standing between
them and total energy dominance.

464
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:08,097
We can no longer compete.
Soon, they'll control the energy supply

465
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:11,830
of half the world.
In effect, they become a new superpower.

466
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:16,191
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

467
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:21,174
That's where we come in.
How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?

468
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:24,317
Rumor is, the relationship
is quite complicated.

469
00:43:24,419 --> 00:43:26,889
But we can't work based
solely on rumor, can't we?

470
00:43:26,936 --> 00:43:31,796
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning, Fischer Sr's right hand man.

471
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:33,916
Fischer Jr's godfather.

472
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:37,286
It should be possible.
If you can get the right references.

473
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:41,282
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

474
00:43:42,292 --> 00:43:45,549
I'm not smelling settlement here.
Take them down.

475
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,526
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
policy is always one of avoiding litigation.

476
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:57,019
Shall we voice your
concerns with Maurice directly?

477
00:43:57,465 --> 00:44:00,647
- Not sure if that's necessary.
- No, no, no. I think we should.

478
00:44:21,834 --> 00:44:26,413
How is he?
I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...

479
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,895
Robert, did I tell you to keep out of town...
Wait, just do it.

480
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:32,936
No, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.

481
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,343
Follow through!

482
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,214
Never.
Never gonna send what I asked.

483
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:42,575
Leave town.

484
00:44:44,834 --> 00:44:46,599
Terrible.

485
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,876
Must be a cherish memory of his.

486
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:56,488
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

487
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,045
Robert...we need to talk about the power of attorney.

488
00:45:03,096 --> 00:45:04,473
- I know this is hard right now.
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

489
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:06,204
but it's imperative that we start to...

490
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:12,241
The vultures are circling.

491
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:15,403
The sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

492
00:45:16,384 --> 00:45:18,616
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

493
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,522
adopt his physical presence,
study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

494
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:26,749
Now, in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

495
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:30,611
And suggest concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind.

496
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:33,126
Then, when we take
him a level deeper his own

497
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,431
projection of Browning should,
should feedback right back to him.

498
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:38,950
- So he gives himself the idea.
- Precisely.

499
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:42,240
That's the only way it will stick.
He has to see himself generate it.

500
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:45,165
Eames, I am impress.

501
00:45:45,967 --> 00:45:49,223
Your confession, has always as
much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.

502
00:46:09,504 --> 00:46:11,630
Were you going out there on your own?

503
00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:14,510
No, no. I was just...
just running some experiments.

504
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:17,526
I didn't realize anyone was here.
So...

505
00:46:17,598 --> 00:46:21,427
- Yeah, I was just, I was working on my totem actually.
- Here, let me take a look.

506
00:46:23,335 --> 00:46:24,663
So you're learning, huh?

507
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,754
An elegant solution for
keeping track of reality.

508
00:46:28,862 --> 00:46:32,403
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was...it's Mal's, actually.

509
00:46:32,403 --> 00:46:37,678
This. This one was hers.
You spin it in a dream and it would never topple.

510
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:40,999
Just...spin and spin.

511
00:46:41,948 --> 00:46:47,270
- Arthur told me she past away.
- How are the mazes coming on?

512
00:46:47,712 --> 00:46:50,832
Each level relates to the part of
the subject's subconscious that...

513
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:52,264
we are trying to access.

514
00:46:52,314 --> 00:46:57,201
So, making the bottom level, hospitals.
So Fischer will bring his father.

515
00:46:57,438 --> 00:47:00,570
Actually I have a question
about this layout.

516
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:04,620
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

517
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:06,632
Why is that so important?

518
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,673
In case one of us brings in our projections

519
00:47:08,724 --> 00:47:11,001
we don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

520
00:47:11,942 --> 00:47:14,731
You mean, in case you bring Mal in.

521
00:47:14,938 --> 00:47:18,599
- Well, you can't keep her out, can you?
- Right.

522
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:22,555
You can't build because if you
know the maze then she knows it.

523
00:47:23,124 --> 00:47:25,400
Which should sabotage the whole operation.

524
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:27,612
- Cobb, did the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

525
00:47:28,031 --> 00:47:29,986
You gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

526
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:32,593
No one said it's getting worse.

527
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:36,178
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

528
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:44,483
- Why can't you go home?
- Because they think I killed her.

529
00:47:47,515 --> 00:47:49,701
- Thank you.
- For what?

530
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:51,991
For not asking whether I did.

531
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:54,484
"I'll split up my father's empire."

532
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:58,186
Now, this is obviously an idea
that Robert himself will choose to reject.

533
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:01,452
That's why we need to plant
it deep in the subconscious.

534
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:05,138
Subconscious is motivated by emotion, right?
Not reason.

535
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,423
We need to find a way to translate
this into an emotional concept.

536
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:10,693
How do you translate a
business strategy to an emotion?

537
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:11,206
MAURICE AND ROBERT
TWO GENERATIONS OF FISCHER
TWO VERY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MANAGEMENT

538
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:12,652
That's what we're here to figure out, right?

539
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:16,034
Now, Robert's relationship with his
father is stressed, to say the least.

540
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,443
I can't remember that.

541
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:21,026
Because suggesting him to break up his
father's company is a "screw you" to the old man.

542
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:22,676
No, cause I think positive emotion...

543
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:24,730
triumphs negative emotion everytime.

544
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:27,683
We're all hearing for a reconciliation.
A catharsis.

545
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:32,102
We need Robert Fischer to have a
positive emotional reaction to all this.

546
00:48:32,147 --> 00:48:34,055
Alright, well, try this.

547
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:38,734
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself not follow in his footsteps."

548
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,489
That might work.
Might.

549
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,834
We're gonna need to do a little
better than might.

550
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:45,365
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

551
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:48,305
Forgive me for wanting a little specificity,
Eames.

552
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:51,819
- Specificity?
- Inception is not about being specific.

553
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,998
When we get inside his mind, we're gonna
have to work at what we find.

554
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,952
On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father.

555
00:49:00,044 --> 00:49:03,189
And seed...
"I will not follow in my father's footsteps".

556
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:07,730
And the next level down, we feed him with:
"I will create something for myself".

557
00:49:08,376 --> 00:49:10,714
By the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

558
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:13,076
- "My father doesn't want me to be him".
- Exactly.

559
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:18,243
With three layers down, the dreams are
gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.

560
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,815
Sedation.

561
00:49:19,815 --> 00:49:22,934
For a sleep stable enough to
create three layers of dreaming

562
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:25,766
we have to combine with
an extremely powerful sedative.

563
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:38,549
Good night.

564
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,997
The compound that'll be
used to share the dream

565
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:42,812
creates avery clear
connection between dreamers

566
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:45,395
plus actually accelerating brain function.

567
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:47,684
In other words, it gives us
more time on each level.

568
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,606
Brain function in the dream
will be about twenty times normal.

569
00:49:50,803 --> 00:49:54,046
When you enter a dream within that dream
the effect is compounded.

570
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:57,786
- It's three dreams, that's 10 hours, that's twenty...
- I'm sorry, math is never my strong subject.

571
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:01,743
- How much time is that?
- It's a week the first level down.

572
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,329
Six months the second level
and the third level...

573
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,371
Is ten years.

574
00:50:08,952 --> 00:50:11,748
Who would wanna be stuck
in a dream for ten years?

575
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:13,322
Depends on the dream.

576
00:50:13,341 --> 00:50:15,895
So once we've made the plants
how do we get out?

577
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:18,974
I'm hoping you have something more elegant
in mind than shooting me in the head.

578
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,196
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

579
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:25,302
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

580
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:28,705
It's that feeling of falling,
you get the jolts, you awaken

581
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:30,527
snaps you out of the dream.

582
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,246
Are we gonna feel a kick
with this kind of sedation?

583
00:50:32,256 --> 00:50:33,781
Oh, that's the counterpart.

584
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:36,369
I've customized it to leave
any ear function unimpaired.

585
00:50:36,932 --> 00:50:40,633
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

586
00:50:41,854 --> 00:50:44,146
Or tipping.

587
00:50:44,557 --> 00:50:46,431
The trick is to synchronize a kick

588
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:49,159
that can penetrate all three levels.

589
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:51,906
We can use a musical content
to synchronize the different kicks.

590
00:51:00,047 --> 00:51:03,846
He doesn't have any surgery scheduled,
No dental, nothing.

591
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:05,703
Wasn't he suppose to
have a knee operation?

592
00:51:05,715 --> 00:51:10,565
Nothing. Nothing that will put him under for any REM.
We need...We need at least a good ten hours.

593
00:51:10,623 --> 00:51:12,395
Sydney to Los Angeles.

594
00:51:12,928 --> 00:51:16,844
One of the longest flights in the world.
He makes it every two weeks.

595
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,615
And he must be flying private.

596
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:23,077
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.

597
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:25,628
- But that should be a 747.
- Why is that?

598
00:51:25,653 --> 00:51:27,441
Cause in a 747 the pilot's up top

599
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,685
and the first class cabin is in the nose.
So no one would walk through.

600
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:33,757
But you'd have to buy out the entire cabin.
And the first class flight.

601
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:38,882
I bought the airline.
It seemed little.

602
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:43,047
Well, looks like we have our ten hours.

603
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,752
Ariadne?
Terrific work, by the way.

604
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,545
You know how to find me.
You know what you have to do.

605
00:52:40,962 --> 00:52:44,128
Do you remember when
you ask me to marry you?

606
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:49,937
- Of course I do.
- You said you had a dream.

607
00:52:53,787 --> 00:52:56,113
That will grow old together.

608
00:52:57,531 --> 00:52:59,574
And we can.

609
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,771
You shouldn't be here.

610
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:14,523
I just want to see what kind of tests
you're doing here alone every night.

611
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,617
- Whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you.
- It has everything to do with me.

612
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:22,627
- You've asked me to share dreams with you.
- Not these. These are my dreams.

613
00:53:33,886 --> 00:53:37,906
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- It's the only way I can still dream.

614
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:45,584
- Why is it so important to dream?
- In my dreams, we're still together.

615
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,692
These aren't just dreams.

616
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:06,008
These are memories and you
said never to use memories.

617
00:54:06,262 --> 00:54:09,141
- I know I did.
- You're trying to keep her alive.

618
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:13,760
- You can't let her go.
- You don't understand.

619
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:17,304
These are moments that I regret
and memories that I have to change.

620
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,213
Oh, what's down there that you regret?

621
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,354
Listen, I do know one thing that you
need to understand about me.

622
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:36,187
- Is this your house?
- Mine and Mal's, yes.

623
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:41,427
- Where is she?
- She's already died.

624
00:54:45,822 --> 00:54:50,222
That's my son, James. He's digging
for something, maybe a worm.

625
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:53,717
That's Phillipa.

626
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:58,313
You see, I thought about calling out to them so
they'd turn and smile and I can those

627
00:54:58,787 --> 00:55:03,615
those beautiful faces of
theirs but...it's all too late.

628
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,264
Right now, or never, Cobb.

629
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:15,851
Then I start to panic. I realized I
don't want to regret this moment that...

630
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:18,392
I need to see their faces one last time.

631
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,955
James! Phillipa!
Come on in!

632
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:24,551
But the moment's passed.

633
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:28,651
And whatever I do,
I can't change this moment.

634
00:55:29,232 --> 00:55:33,896
So I'm about to call out
to them and run away.

635
00:55:36,368 --> 00:55:39,616
If I'm ever gonna see their faces again,
I've gotta get back home.

636
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:41,826
The real world.

637
00:56:21,704 --> 00:56:25,059
- What are you doing here?
- My name is...

638
00:56:25,143 --> 00:56:28,103
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

639
00:56:36,168 --> 00:56:39,932
- I'm just trying to understand.
- How could you understand?

640
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:44,889
Do you know what it is to be a lover?

641
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:49,693
- To be half in a whole?
- No.

642
00:56:51,978 --> 00:56:53,537
I'll tell you a riddle.

643
00:56:55,025 --> 00:57:00,844
You're waiting for a train.
A train that will take you far away.

644
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:08,351
You know where you hope this train will take you.
But you don't know for sure.

645
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:15,312
But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter
to you where the train will take you?

646
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,064
Cause we will be together.

647
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,816
- How could you bring her here, Dom?
- What is this place?

648
00:57:21,095 --> 00:57:24,276
This is the hotel suite where
we should spend our anniversary.

649
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,879
What happened here?

650
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:30,715
You promised!
You promised we'll be together!

651
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,640
Please, I need you stay here!
Just for now!

652
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:36,099
You said we'll be together!
You said we'll grow old together!

653
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:38,110
I'll come back for you.
Promise.

654
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,296
Do you think you can just build a
prison of memories to lock her in?

655
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:04,350
Do you really think that
that's gonna contain her?

656
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,769
It's time.
Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

657
00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:11,871
- When is the funeral?
- Thursday, in Los Angeles.

658
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,948
Robert should accompany the body
no later than Tuesday. We should move.

659
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,476
Right.

660
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,936
- Cobb, I'm coming with you.
- I promised Miles, no.

661
00:58:20,012 --> 00:58:23,318
The team needs someone who
understands what you're struggling with.

662
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,263
And it doesn't have to be me.

663
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:31,033
But then you have to show
Arthur what I just saw.

664
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:38,571
Get us another seat on the plane.

665
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:45,339
If I get on this plane and you
don't honor our agreement.

666
00:58:45,476 --> 00:58:48,418
When we land, I go to jail
for the rest of my life.

667
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:53,829
Complete the job on board.
I'll make one phone call from the plane.

668
00:58:53,898 --> 00:58:56,779
You will have no trouble
getting through Immigration.

669
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,448
- Yes, it is.
- Thanks.

670
00:59:03,449 --> 00:59:04,003
Yes.

671
00:59:04,004 --> 00:59:06,215
- Third seat on the right.
- Thanks.

672
00:59:10,288 --> 00:59:12,765
- I'm sorry.
- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, my bad.

673
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:24,752
- Welcome aboard, sir. May I take your coat?
- Thank you.

674
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:44,281
FASTEN SEAT BELTS.
NO SMOKING.

675
00:59:46,288 --> 00:59:49,526
Excuse me, I think this is yours?
You must've dropped it.

676
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:52,278
- Gentlemen, can I have your drink?
- Oh, water please.

677
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:54,182
The same, please.

678
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:59,113
Thank you.

679
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:02,601
You know I couldn't help but notice
but you won't happen to be related to...

680
01:00:02,652 --> 01:00:04,286
"The Maurice Fischer", would you?

681
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:11,529
- Yes, he...he was my father.
- Well he was a very inspiring figure.

682
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,046
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Sir.

683
01:00:15,603 --> 01:00:17,873
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

684
01:00:18,088 --> 01:00:23,619
Hey, to your father.
May he rest in peace, huh.

685
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:30,880
You couldn't have peed
before you went on there.

686
01:01:30,931 --> 01:01:31,646
Sorry.

687
01:01:31,696 --> 01:01:33,819
Pitching much free champagne
before take off, right, Yusuf?

688
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,729
Haha. Bloody hard.

689
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:37,313
Well now, he's gonna be
looking for a taxi in this weather.

690
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:52,179
- Asshole! Hey man, why don't you try...
- Walk away.

691
01:02:08,238 --> 01:02:11,655
Look, I gotta go. Alright.
Taxi. Thank you.

692
01:02:14,778 --> 01:02:17,117
Alright. Third and Market. Snappy.

693
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:18,799
What are you doing?

694
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:20,766
- Oh sorry, I thought it was free.
- Well, it's not.

695
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:22,704
- Maybe we could share.
- Maybe not.

696
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:24,270
Can you pull over and get this...

697
01:02:27,238 --> 01:02:28,409
Great.

698
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,618
Come on!

699
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:48,187
There's $500 in there and
the wallet's worth more than that.

700
01:02:48,253 --> 01:02:50,117
So you might as well
drop me at my stop.

701
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,272
I'm afraid that this...

702
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:00,755
Cover him!

703
01:03:00,806 --> 01:03:03,925
No! No! No!
What was going on?

704
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:09,221
This wasn't in my design.

705
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:12,971
Cobb?
Cobb?

706
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:02,826
Get him!

707
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:12,750
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

708
01:04:13,203 --> 01:04:15,128
Fischer's okay.
Unless he gets carsick.

709
01:04:15,214 --> 01:04:16,319
Saito?

710
01:04:34,312 --> 01:04:35,585
Get Fischer in the back room now!

711
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:39,685
- Get him the back room.!
- What the hell...

712
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,541
- Has he been shot? Is he dying?
- I don't know.

713
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:42,392
Jesus Christ.

714
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:45,493
- Where were you? What happened to you?
- The girl played a freight train.

715
01:04:45,734 --> 01:04:47,648
Why did you put a train crossing
in the middle of a downtown interstate?

716
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:49,133
- I didn't.
- Where did it come from?

717
01:04:49,183 --> 01:04:51,017
Let me ask you a question!
Why the hell were you ambushed?

718
01:04:51,415 --> 01:04:53,911
Those were not normal projections!
They've been trained for God's sakes!

719
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,450
- You're right.
- How can they be trained?

720
01:04:55,539 --> 01:04:59,504
Fischer had an extractor that
teaches subconscious to defend itself.

721
01:04:59,555 --> 01:05:01,498
So his subconscious is militarized.

722
01:05:01,548 --> 01:05:02,963
It should've shown in the research.
I'm sorry.

723
01:05:03,011 --> 01:05:05,407
- So why the hell didn't it?
- Calm down.

724
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:07,790
Don't tell me to calm down.
This was your job, goddamn it!

725
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:11,740
This was your responsibility! You were meant to
check Fischer's background thoroughly!

726
01:05:11,813 --> 01:05:13,295
We are not prepared for
this type of violence!

727
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:15,083
We have dealt with
self-security before!

728
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,863
We'll be a little more careful
and we're gonna be fine!

729
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:19,144
This was not a part of the plan!
He's dying for God's sake!

730
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,569
- Now, let's put him out of his misery.
- No, no!

731
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,056
- Don't do that!
- What's the matter, Cobb?

732
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:24,769
- Don't do that
- He's in agony, I'm waking him up.

733
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:28,445
- No, it won't wake him up.
- What do you mean, it won't wake him up?

734
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:30,815
- It won't wake him up.
- When we die in a dream, we wake up.

735
01:05:30,853 --> 01:05:34,470
Not from this. We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way.

736
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,818
- Right, so what happens when we die?
- We drop in a limbo.

737
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:39,801
- Are you serious?
- Limbo?

738
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:42,805
- Unconstructed dream space.
- What the hell is down there?

739
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:46,202
Just raw infinite subconscious.
Nothing is down there.

740
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:48,734
Except for whatever might have been left
behind by anyone sharing the dream

741
01:05:48,785 --> 01:05:52,980
who has been trapped there before.
Which in our case, is just you.

742
01:05:53,045 --> 01:05:54,615
How long can we be stuck there?

743
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:56,959
I can't even think about trying to
escape until the sedation is...

744
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:59,989
- How long, Yusuf?
- Decades, It could be infinite. I don't know.

745
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,373
Ask him he's the one who's been there.

746
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:03,205
Just get him upstairs.

747
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:07,127
Great.
Thank you.

748
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:11,859
So, now we're trapped in Fischer's
mind battling his own private army...

749
01:06:11,892 --> 01:06:14,342
and if we get killed,
we'll be lost in limbo

750
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:16,541
till our brains turn
to scrambled egg, hmm?

751
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:25,183
You got first aid?

752
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:29,805
So you knew about this
risk and you didn't tell us?

753
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,749
There weren't meant to be any risk cause
I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.

754
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,576
- You had no right
- It was the only way to go three layers deep.

755
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:39,192
- And you, you knew about this and went along with it?
- I trusted him.

756
01:06:39,201 --> 01:06:41,065
You trusted him. What?
Did he promise you half his share?

757
01:06:41,082 --> 01:06:44,513
No. His whole share.
It's like he said, he'd done it before.

758
01:06:44,564 --> 01:06:47,478
He'd done it before, what, with Mal?
Cause that worked so good?

759
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:49,862
It has nothing to do with it. I did what
I had to do to get back to my children.

760
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:51,756
So you lead us into a
war zone with no way out.

761
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:55,569
There is a way out. Alright, we continue on with
the job and we do this as fast as possible.

762
01:06:55,963 --> 01:06:58,620
and we get out using the kick.
Just like before.

763
01:06:58,671 --> 01:07:01,152
Forget it, If we go any deeper
we'll just raise the stakes.

764
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:02,850
I am sitting this one
out on this level, boys.

765
01:07:02,901 --> 01:07:05,384
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak.

766
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,527
Ten hours of flight time
is a week at this level.

767
01:07:07,578 --> 01:07:11,889
That means each and every one of
us will be killed. That I can guarantee.

768
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:15,150
We have no other choice but to
continue on and do it as fast as possible.

769
01:07:16,561 --> 01:07:19,863
Downwards is the only way forward.

770
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:24,420
Get ready.
You, come on let's go shake him up.

771
01:07:27,966 --> 01:07:31,531
I'm insured against kidnapping
for up to ten million.

772
01:07:31,582 --> 01:07:35,238
- This should be very simple.
- Shut up! It won't be.

773
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,423
In your father's office, below the
bookshelf is his personal safe.

774
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:41,893
- We need the combination.
- I don't know any safe.

775
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:44,950
It doesn't mean you
don't know the combination.

776
01:07:45,781 --> 01:07:49,748
- Tell us what it is.
- I don't know.

777
01:07:55,055 --> 01:07:57,183
We have an old good
authority you do know.

778
01:07:57,262 --> 01:07:59,932
Yeah? Who is this authority?

779
01:08:00,647 --> 01:08:02,785
$500, this cost?

780
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:07,479
- What's inside?
- Cash cards, ID, and this.

781
01:08:12,362 --> 01:08:16,161
- Useful?
- Maybe.

782
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:19,509
- You're on. We've got an hour.
- An hour?

783
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,792
I was supposed to
have all night to practice.

784
01:08:22,843 --> 01:08:25,470
Saito wasn't supposed to
be shot in the chest.

785
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:28,609
We got one hour, now get
use something useful, please.

786
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:34,296
- What's that?
- Good authority.

787
01:08:37,255 --> 01:08:38,499
Uncle Peter...

788
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:39,483
No, no.

789
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:43,420
- Just make him stop.
- The combination.

790
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:46,442
- I don't know it.
- Why does Browning say you do?

791
01:08:46,533 --> 01:08:50,413
I don't know.
Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.

792
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:55,083
You have one hour.
Start talking.

793
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:58,013
Are you alright?

794
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:01,300
Are you okay?

795
01:09:03,647 --> 01:09:07,530
Those bastards bad
at me for two days.

796
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:12,057
They have someone with access to your father's
office and they're trying to open his safe.

797
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:15,883
- Yeah.
- They said I'd know the combination. But I don't know it.

798
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:18,563
- Yeah, neither do I.
- What?

799
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:22,960
Maurice told me that when he past,
you were the only to be able to open it.

800
01:09:23,016 --> 01:09:24,913
No, he never gave
me any combination.

801
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:29,298
Maybe he did, I mean, maybe you just
didn't know it was a combination.

802
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,849
Well, what then?

803
01:09:30,884 --> 01:09:33,219
I don't know. Some meaningful
combination of numbers

804
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,670
based on your experiences with Maurice.

805
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:42,938
We didn't have very...
many meaningful experiences together.

806
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,255
Perhaps after your mother died.

807
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:50,863
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

808
01:09:51,121 --> 01:09:58,866
- "Robert, there's really nothing to be said".
- Oh well, he was bad with emotion.

809
01:09:58,868 --> 01:10:01,630
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

810
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:05,582
- How is he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

811
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:08,696
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

812
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:12,732
- And if he dies?
- Worst case scenario?

813
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,650
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

814
01:10:15,724 --> 01:10:21,568
- Cobb, I will still honor the arrangement.
- I appreciate that, Saito.

815
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:25,514
But when you wake up you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

816
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,962
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

817
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:31,940
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

818
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:36,333
- Filled with regret?
- Waiting to die alone.

819
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:42,540
No, I'll come back.
And we will be alive together again.

820
01:10:48,349 --> 01:10:49,321
Breath.

821
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:52,510
These people are gonna kill us if
we don't give them the combination.

822
01:10:52,536 --> 01:10:54,889
- They just want a ransom.
- I heard them.

823
01:10:54,938 --> 01:10:58,632
They're gonna whack us in that van
and then drive it into the river.

824
01:10:58,711 --> 01:11:02,028
- Alright. What is in the safe?
- Something for you.

825
01:11:02,110 --> 01:11:06,717
Maurice always said it was
his most precious gift to you.

826
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:08,384
A will.

827
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,497
Maurice's Will is with Port and Dunn.

828
01:11:10,563 --> 01:11:14,255
That's an alternate. This would
supercede the other if you wanted to.

829
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,790
It splits off the component
business of Fischer-Morrow

830
01:11:16,845 --> 01:11:20,056
And it'd be the end of the
entire empire as we know it.

831
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:26,523
Destroy my whole inheritance.
Why would he suggest that, you think?

832
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:31,771
I just don't know.
He loved you, Robert.

833
01:11:32,945 --> 01:11:36,197
- In his own way.
- In his own way?

834
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:42,079
At the end, he called
me into his deathbed

835
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:44,764
And he could barely speak.

836
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:50,783
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

837
01:11:51,494 --> 01:12:00,058
He pulled me closer.
And I could only make out... one word.

838
01:12:03,294 --> 01:12:05,777
"Disappointed".

839
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,032
When were you in limbo?

840
01:12:13,426 --> 01:12:17,020
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job

841
01:12:17,072 --> 01:12:18,289
but they don't know the truth.

842
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:19,727
Truth? What truth?

843
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:24,098
The truth that at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

844
01:12:24,235 --> 01:12:27,706
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

845
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:30,129
And the truth that as we go
deeper into Fischer

846
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,465
we're also going deeper into you.

847
01:12:32,656 --> 01:12:36,846
And I...I'm not sure we're
gonna like what we find.

848
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:45,485
We were working together. We were exploring
the concept of a dream within a dream.

849
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:49,912
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper
and deeper. I wanted to go further.

850
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:55,193
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there.

851
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:58,984
That we could get trapped so deep.
That when we...

852
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:01,785
when wind up on the
shore of our subconscious

853
01:13:01,793 --> 01:13:04,714
we lost side of what was real.

854
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,562
We created.
We built a world for ourselves.

855
01:13:14,588 --> 01:13:19,780
We did that for years.
We built our own world.

856
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:25,631
- How long were you stuck there?
- Something like fifty years.

857
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:34,071
Jesus.
How could you stand it?

858
01:13:34,128 --> 01:13:36,453
It wasn't so bad at first.
Feeling like gods.

859
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:39,499
The problem was that I knew
that none of that was real.

860
01:13:39,551 --> 01:13:43,889
Eventually, it has became impossible
for me to live like that.

861
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:46,404
And what about for her?

862
01:13:49,022 --> 01:13:52,245
She has locked something away.
Something deep inside her.

863
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:59,085
The truth that she once known.
She chose to forget.

864
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:04,079
Limbo became her reality.

865
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,399
What happened when you woke up?

866
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:11,509
Well, to wake up from that after,
after years, after decades...

867
01:14:11,923 --> 01:14:16,632
to become old souls thrown
back into youth like that....

868
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:21,276
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

869
01:14:22,276 --> 01:14:27,968
Eventually, she told me the truth.
She was possessed by an idea.

870
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:33,111
This one, very simple idea
that changed everything.

871
01:14:34,048 --> 01:14:36,833
That our world wasn't real.

872
01:14:38,035 --> 01:14:41,437
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality, that...

873
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:47,578
in order to get back home...
We had to kill ourselves.

874
01:14:54,105 --> 01:14:57,936
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections.

875
01:14:57,987 --> 01:14:59,967
That our real children are waiting
for us out there somewhere.

876
01:15:00,018 --> 01:15:02,262
- Look, Cobb! I'm their mother.
- Calm down.

877
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,415
Can't you even tell the difference?

878
01:15:04,492 --> 01:15:06,333
If this is my dream, why can't I control this?

879
01:15:06,384 --> 01:15:07,836
Because you don't know you're dreaming!

880
01:15:07,863 --> 01:15:11,519
She was certain there was nothing
I could do, no matter how much I begged...

881
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:13,699
no matter how much I pleaded.

882
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:19,875
She wanted to do it.
But she could not do it alone.

883
01:15:19,909 --> 01:15:25,702
She loved me too much so...
She came up with a plan on our anniversary.

884
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,621
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

885
01:15:54,026 --> 01:15:58,298
Just step back inside, alright?
Just step back inside now, come on.

886
01:15:58,386 --> 01:16:06,630
- No. I'm going to jump and you're coming with me.
- No, I'm not. But now, you listen to me.

887
01:16:06,997 --> 01:16:10,426
If you jump, you're
not gonna wake up, remember?

888
01:16:10,479 --> 01:16:16,132
You're gonna die. Now, just step back inside, come on.
Step back inside so we can talk about this.

889
01:16:16,182 --> 01:16:19,305
We've talked enough.

890
01:16:19,895 --> 01:16:23,129
- Mal.
- Come out unto the ledge or I'll jump right now.

891
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,428
Okay.

892
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:31,884
We're gonna talk about this.
Alright?

893
01:16:32,451 --> 01:16:37,259
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

894
01:16:37,946 --> 01:16:40,758
I can't. You know,
I can't do that.

895
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:43,138
Take a second and think
about our children.

896
01:16:43,176 --> 01:16:47,512
Think about James.
Think about Phillipa, now.

897
01:16:47,568 --> 01:16:50,364
If I go without you,
they'll take them away, anyway.

898
01:16:50,449 --> 01:16:52,297
What does that mean?

899
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:54,546
I filed a letter with our attorney

900
01:16:54,597 --> 01:16:57,144
explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.

901
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:02,461
How you threatened to kill me.

902
01:17:03,907 --> 01:17:07,268
- Why did you do that?
- I love you, Dom.

903
01:17:07,303 --> 01:17:09,412
Why did you..why...
why would you do this to me?

904
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:12,021
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

905
01:17:12,097 --> 01:17:15,101
We're going home.
To our real children.

906
01:17:15,155 --> 01:17:18,875
No, no, no, no, Mal, You listen to me!
Alright? Mal, look at me, please.

907
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:20,528
You're waiting for a train.

908
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:24,339
- Mal,goddamn it! Don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

909
01:17:24,358 --> 01:17:27,957
- James and Phillipa are waiting for you!
- You know where you hope this train will take you.

910
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:29,734
- They're waiting for us!
- But you can't know for sure.

911
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:32,404
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

912
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,376
- Mal, goddamn it!
- Because you will be together.

913
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:41,354
Sweetheart, look at me!
Mal, no! Jesus Christ!

914
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:47,749
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

915
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,926
That made it impossible for me to try to
explain the nature of her madness.

916
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,063
So, I ran...

917
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:57,423
Right now, or never, Cobb.

918
01:18:07,076 --> 01:18:09,507
Alright, let's go.

919
01:18:09,527 --> 01:18:12,906
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy myself back ever since.

920
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:17,225
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

921
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:21,093
But you are not responsible for
the idea that destroyed her.

922
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:24,013
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

923
01:18:24,064 --> 01:18:29,220
you have to forgive yourself.
You're gonna have to confront her.

924
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:31,222
But you don't have to do that alone.

925
01:18:31,308 --> 01:18:33,647
- No, no, you don't...
- I'm doing it for the others.

926
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:38,399
Because they have no idea of the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

927
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,310
We have to move.

928
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,255
- Time's up.
- Alright. I don't know any combination.

929
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:52,588
- Not consciously anyway.
- How about instinctively, huh?

930
01:18:52,781 --> 01:18:55,488
I got somebody standing in
front of his office right now

931
01:18:55,539 --> 01:18:56,777
ready to tap in the combination.

932
01:18:56,844 --> 01:18:59,780
I need the first six numbers that
come to your head right now.

933
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:01,669
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

934
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:08,477
- I said right now! Right now!
- 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1.

935
01:19:11,715 --> 01:19:13,552
You'd have to do better than that.

936
01:19:13,562 --> 01:19:17,789
Alright. Gag him.
We're going for a ride.

937
01:19:20,961 --> 01:19:25,496
What more do you like?
To kill me?

938
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:31,986
What did you get?

939
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:34,773
That boy's relationship with his father
is even worse than we imagined.

940
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:35,613
This helps us how?

941
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:38,344
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

942
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,373
How are you gonna reconcile
then pursue his strengths?

943
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:44,249
- Well I'm working on that, don't I?
- Move fast.

944
01:19:44,297 --> 01:19:46,128
Projections are closing in quick.

945
01:19:46,774 --> 01:19:49,747
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

946
01:20:23,563 --> 01:20:24,777
Damn it.

947
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:27,532
You mustn't be afraid to
dream a little bigger, darling.

948
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:46,737
Now, we need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

949
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,718
We're gonna destroy his
one positive relationship?

950
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:50,448
No, we'll repair his relationship with his father

951
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:52,948
by exposing his godfather's true nature.

952
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:56,510
We should thrice Fischer's
loot more than Saito's mission.

953
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,846
What about his security?
It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.

954
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,657
- No, I think we're going with Mr. Charles.
- No.

955
01:21:01,743 --> 01:21:03,412
- Who's Mr. Charles?
- A bad ides.

956
01:21:03,485 --> 01:21:05,359
The second we get into that
hotel and approach Fischer

957
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:09,455
his security will be all over us.
We run with Mr. Charles like we did on this timed job.

958
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:11,559
- So, you've done it before?
- Yeah, and it didn't worked.

959
01:21:11,603 --> 01:21:14,580
The subject realized that he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

960
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:16,117
Excellent.
But you've learned a lot, right?

961
01:21:16,168 --> 01:21:18,110
I need some kind of distraction.

962
01:21:18,161 --> 01:21:21,036
No problem. How about a
lovely lady that I've used before?

963
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:23,117
- Listen to me. You drive carefully, alright?
- Yeah.

964
01:21:23,143 --> 01:21:25,824
getting down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

965
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:33,471
Don't jump too soon. We only have one
shot at that kick you're gonna make.

966
01:21:33,502 --> 01:21:35,877
I'll play the music and you'll know
it's coming, the rest is on you.

967
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:38,352
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

968
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,678
Sweet dreams.

969
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:42,263
Am I boring you?

970
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:47,591
I was telling you my story.
I guess it wasn't to your liking.

971
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:51,011
I have a lot in my mind.

972
01:21:52,272 --> 01:21:54,544
There goes Mr. Charles.

973
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:01,379
Mr. Fischer, right?

974
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,695
Pleasure to see you again.
Rod Green from marketing.

975
01:22:05,495 --> 01:22:08,368
- And you must be?
- Leaving.

976
01:22:11,811 --> 01:22:13,499
In case you get bored.

977
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:19,712
She must have blown you off.

978
01:22:19,762 --> 01:22:22,749
That is unless her phone
number really is only six digits.

979
01:22:22,773 --> 01:22:23,979
<i>528-491</i>

980
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:28,198
Funny way to make friends,
someone stealing their wallet like that.

981
01:22:31,604 --> 01:22:33,930
Goddamn it.
The wallet alone is worth at least...

982
01:22:34,462 --> 01:22:35,845
$500, right?

983
01:22:35,897 --> 01:22:38,837
Listen, don't worry about it.
My people are already on it as we speak.

984
01:22:38,848 --> 01:22:40,766
Who or what is Mr. Charles?

985
01:22:40,793 --> 01:22:44,347
It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

986
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:46,131
And why don't you approve?

987
01:22:46,142 --> 01:22:48,120
Cause it involves telling
the mark that he's dreaming`

988
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,487
which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

989
01:22:50,527 --> 01:22:52,596
So Cobb said he couldn't do that?

990
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:55,492
So now you've noticed
how much time Cobb spends

991
01:22:55,544 --> 01:22:58,037
doing things he says never to do.

992
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,347
Mr. Saito, may I have a moment?

993
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:03,696
- I'm sorry, but...
- Wait!

994
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:08,380
- You looked to be "livelier".
- Very amusing, Mr. Eames.

995
01:23:14,485 --> 01:23:16,124
Turbulence on the plane?

996
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,675
No, I mean, it's must closer.
It's Yusuf's driving.

997
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:31,636
- I'm sorry, who did you say you were?
- Rod Green from marketing.

998
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:34,329
That's not true at all, is it?

999
01:23:35,737 --> 01:23:39,096
My name is Mr. Charles.
You remember me, don't you?

1000
01:23:39,231 --> 01:23:41,755
I'm the head of your security down here.

1001
01:23:41,775 --> 01:23:44,415
Get out on a different floor and keep moving.

1002
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,841
Dump the wallet.
The security will look for that.

1003
01:23:47,205 --> 01:23:50,366
- Okay.
- We need to buy Cobb a lot more time.

1004
01:23:53,636 --> 01:23:55,304
Security, huh?

1005
01:23:56,809 --> 01:23:59,560
- You work for the hotel?
- No, no.

1006
01:23:59,682 --> 01:24:06,037
I specialize in a very specific type of security.
Subconscious security.

1007
01:24:06,077 --> 01:24:11,415
Are you talking about dreams?
Are you talking about extraction?

1008
01:24:11,491 --> 01:24:16,289
I am here to protect you.
Look...

1009
01:24:20,524 --> 01:24:22,631
<i>Excellent work.
Now, what is your plan?...</i>

1010
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:28,470
Mr. Fischer, I am here to
protect you in the event

1011
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:32,308
that someone tries to access
your mind through your dreams.

1012
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:37,426
You're not safe here.
They're coming for you.

1013
01:24:55,022 --> 01:24:57,159
Strange weather, isn't it?

1014
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:04,180
You feel that?

1015
01:25:04,268 --> 01:25:05,756
What's happening?

1016
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:08,834
Cobb is drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream

1017
01:25:08,885 --> 01:25:11,553
which is making his subconscious
look for the dreamer.

1018
01:25:11,879 --> 01:25:14,989
For me.
Quick, give me a kiss.

1019
01:25:19,689 --> 01:25:23,119
-They're still looking at us.
- Yeah, it's worth a shot.

1020
01:25:23,223 --> 01:25:25,628
We should probably get out of here.

1021
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:44,287
Feel that? You've actually been
trained for this, Mr. Fischer.

1022
01:25:44,343 --> 01:25:47,959
Pay attention to the strangeness
of the weather, the shifting gravity.

1023
01:25:47,991 --> 01:25:51,595
None of this is real.
You're in a dream.

1024
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:58,012
Now, the easiest for you to test yourself...

1025
01:25:58,063 --> 01:26:01,721
is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel.
Can you do that?

1026
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,206
See, I don't, I...

1027
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,759
Breath, breath.
Remember your training.

1028
01:26:06,783 --> 01:26:10,176
Accept the fact that you're in a dream
and I'm here to protect you.

1029
01:26:10,227 --> 01:26:11,466
Go on.

1030
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:20,380
- You're not real?
- No, no.

1031
01:26:20,532 --> 01:26:23,033
I'm a projection of your subconscious.

1032
01:26:23,114 --> 01:26:27,662
I was sent here to protect you in the event
that extractors try to pull you into a dream.

1033
01:26:28,114 --> 01:26:31,274
And I believe that's what's
going on right now, Mr. Fischer.

1034
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:36,029
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1035
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:44,628
- Can you get me out of here?
- Right away, follow me.

1036
01:26:57,906 --> 01:26:59,428
Stay there.

1037
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:05,850
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?

1038
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:08,135
These men were sent
here to abduct you, alright.

1039
01:27:08,155 --> 01:27:11,502
If you want my help,
you have to remain calm.

1040
01:27:12,485 --> 01:27:15,789
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.

1041
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:29,800
If this is a dream, I should just
kill myself to wake up, right?

1042
01:27:29,859 --> 01:27:31,852
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.

1043
01:27:31,854 --> 01:27:37,405
I believe they have you sedated and if you
pull that trigger, you may not wake up.

1044
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,456
You may go into a further dream state.
Now, you know what I'm talking about.

1045
01:27:43,755 --> 01:27:46,432
You remember the training.

1046
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,062
Remember what I said to you.
Give me the gun.

1047
01:28:00,852 --> 01:28:03,012
This room should be directly below 528?

1048
01:28:03,014 --> 01:28:04,761
Yeah.

1049
01:28:12,682 --> 01:28:17,895
Think, Mr. Fischer, think
what do you remember from before this dream?

1050
01:28:18,138 --> 01:28:23,144
There was...there was a lot of gunfires.
And there's....rain.

1051
01:28:23,622 --> 01:28:27,354
Uncle Peter.
Oh my God, we've been kidnapped.

1052
01:28:27,413 --> 01:28:29,813
Where were they holding you?

1053
01:28:32,188 --> 01:28:35,342
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1054
01:28:35,457 --> 01:28:37,590
You're in the back of a van right now.
Keep going.

1055
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:42,945
It had something to do with...
something to do with a safe?

1056
01:28:43,724 --> 01:28:45,417
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1057
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,877
It's like trying to remember a
dream after you've woken up.

1058
01:28:47,926 --> 01:28:50,392
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1059
01:28:50,455 --> 01:28:52,776
You and Browning has
been pulled into this dream...

1060
01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:55,186
because they're trying to
steal something from your mind.

1061
01:28:55,237 --> 01:28:58,652
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1062
01:28:58,952 --> 01:29:00,450
What is it, Mr. Fischer?
Think!

1063
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,119
A combination.

1064
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,842
They demanded the first
numbers to pop into my head.

1065
01:29:04,893 --> 01:29:07,284
They're trying to extract the
number from your subconscious.

1066
01:29:07,335 --> 01:29:10,417
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1067
01:29:11,622 --> 01:29:14,723
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1068
01:29:14,774 --> 01:29:17,471
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1069
01:29:17,473 --> 01:29:19,753
Five.

1070
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:22,436
Five, two...
It was something.. it was a long number.

1071
01:29:22,486 --> 01:29:23,595
That's good enough.
We could start there.

1072
01:29:23,788 --> 01:29:25,629
- Fifth floor.
- Yup.

1073
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:29,585
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1074
01:29:29,635 --> 01:29:33,187
While you're all asleep in 528,
I'll wait for Yusuf's kick.

1075
01:29:33,237 --> 01:29:35,169
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1076
01:29:35,219 --> 01:29:38,690
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1077
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:42,292
So we get a nice, synchronized kick.

1078
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:44,602
If it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.

1079
01:29:44,654 --> 01:29:47,761
If it's too late...
I won't be able to drop us.

1080
01:29:47,813 --> 01:29:49,125
Why not?

1081
01:29:49,176 --> 01:29:53,971
Cause of the van, that will be in free fall.
Can't drop you without gravity.

1082
01:29:54,164 --> 01:29:55,830
Right.

1083
01:30:00,207 --> 01:30:03,503
You're with me.
Go on.

1084
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:28,525
- Mr. Charles
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?

1085
01:30:28,576 --> 01:30:32,258
- Yeah, I think so, yeah.
- They were trying to put you under.

1086
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:34,504
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1087
01:30:34,556 --> 01:30:37,633
What do you mean?
A dream within a dream?

1088
01:30:37,634 --> 01:30:40,386
Hey. I see you've changed.

1089
01:30:40,388 --> 01:30:42,291
I'm sorry.

1090
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:46,220
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've mistaken you for a friend.

1091
01:30:47,463 --> 01:30:50,021
Good looking fella, I'm sure.

1092
01:30:51,177 --> 01:30:55,090
That's Fischer's projection of Browning.
Let's follow him and see how he behaves.

1093
01:30:55,092 --> 01:30:57,522
- Why?
- Because how he acts would tell us...

1094
01:30:57,524 --> 01:31:00,572
if Fischer is going to suspect his motives,
the way we wanted to.

1095
01:31:05,712 --> 01:31:08,850
- Uncle Peter.
- You said you were kidnapped together?

1096
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:11,865
Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

1097
01:31:11,867 --> 01:31:14,664
And you saw them torture him?

1098
01:31:20,568 --> 01:31:24,795
- The kidnappers are working for you?
- Robert.

1099
01:31:24,797 --> 01:31:28,841
You're trying to get that safe open?
So you get the alternate will?

1100
01:31:28,843 --> 01:31:32,901
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.

1101
01:31:32,903 --> 01:31:35,341
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance.
Why would I?

1102
01:31:35,343 --> 01:31:39,911
I couldn't let you rise to
your father's last taunt.

1103
01:31:40,305 --> 01:31:43,224
- What taunt?
- The will, Robert, that will.

1104
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,322
That's his last insult.

1105
01:31:45,324 --> 01:31:49,050
A challenge for you to
build something for yourself...

1106
01:31:49,052 --> 01:31:53,231
by telling you you're not
worthy of his accomplishments.

1107
01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:01,242
What, that he was disappointed, hmm?

1108
01:32:01,529 --> 01:32:04,087
I'm sorry.

1109
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:07,573
But...he's wrong.

1110
01:32:08,302 --> 01:32:10,815
You can build a better
company than he ever did.

1111
01:32:10,866 --> 01:32:13,230
Mr. Fischer?
He's lying!

1112
01:32:13,282 --> 01:32:15,352
- How do you know?
- Trust me, it's what I do.

1113
01:32:15,403 --> 01:32:18,330
He's hiding something and
we need to find out what that is.

1114
01:32:19,585 --> 01:32:23,053
I need you to do the same thing to
him that he was going to do to you.

1115
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:28,681
We'll enter his subconscious and find
out what he doesn't want you to know.

1116
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:32,574
Alright.

1117
01:32:37,528 --> 01:32:38,361
He's out.

1118
01:32:38,363 --> 01:32:41,040
Wait, whose subconscious
are we going into exactly?

1119
01:32:41,092 --> 01:32:42,454
We're going into Fischer's.

1120
01:32:42,506 --> 01:32:45,176
But I told him it was Browning's
so he can be a part of our team.

1121
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:47,394
He's gonna help us break
into his own subconscious.

1122
01:32:47,445 --> 01:32:48,426
That's right.

1123
01:32:48,765 --> 01:32:51,376
Security's gonna run you down, huh.

1124
01:32:51,426 --> 01:32:53,886
And I will lead them on a merry chase.

1125
01:32:53,938 --> 01:32:55,561
Just be back here for the kick.

1126
01:32:55,565 --> 01:32:57,359
Go to sleep, Mr. Eames.

1127
01:33:01,515 --> 01:33:03,418
Are you good?

1128
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:10,227
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes. I'm..I'm fine. I'm ready.

1129
01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:27,325
Cobb? Cobb?
What's down there?

1130
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:32,579
Hopefully the truth we
want Fischer to learn.

1131
01:33:32,631 --> 01:33:35,143
I mean, what's down there for you?

1132
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,708
Did you see that?

1133
01:36:24,049 --> 01:36:25,916
Eames, this is your dream.

1134
01:36:25,968 --> 01:36:28,783
I need you to draw the security away
from the complex, you understand?

1135
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,923
- Who will guide Fischer in?
- Not me.

1136
01:36:30,975 --> 01:36:33,329
Find all the route,
everything could be compromised.

1137
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:36,078
- I designed the place.
- No, you're with me.

1138
01:36:36,131 --> 01:36:37,835
I could do it.

1139
01:36:37,887 --> 01:36:40,417
Alright, you'll reach on the
route into the complex.

1140
01:36:40,502 --> 01:36:43,062
- Fischer, you'll be going with him.
- Alright.

1141
01:36:43,149 --> 01:36:47,573
- What about you?
- Keep this alive. I'll be listening in the whole time.

1142
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,550
The windows on that upper
floor are big enough for me...

1143
01:36:49,602 --> 01:36:51,342
to cover you from that south tower.
You see it?

1144
01:36:51,393 --> 01:36:54,211
- Yeah. You're not coming in?
- In order to find out the truth...

1145
01:36:54,263 --> 01:36:57,521
about your father, you're gonna need to
break into Browning's mind on your own.

1146
01:36:58,902 --> 01:37:00,566
Come, Fischer!

1147
01:37:53,589 --> 01:37:57,313
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

1148
01:37:57,366 --> 01:37:58,346
Move!

1149
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,987
Go!

1150
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:17,818
So they're shooting me!

1151
01:38:27,495 --> 01:38:29,066
I hope they're ready.

1152
01:38:37,941 --> 01:38:40,014
It's too soon.

1153
01:38:45,339 --> 01:38:46,921
Cobb, do you hear that?

1154
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:50,228
First heard it about twenty minutes ago.
I thought it was the wind up here.

1155
01:38:50,411 --> 01:38:52,777
Yeah, I hear it.
It's music.

1156
01:38:52,925 --> 01:38:55,947
- So what do we do?
- Move fast.

1157
01:39:00,978 --> 01:39:03,096
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump.

1158
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:06,921
Which gives Arthur three minutes.

1159
01:39:08,223 --> 01:39:10,706
Hey!

1160
01:39:10,759 --> 01:39:12,438
- Which gives us what?
- Sixty minutes.

1161
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:14,035
Can they make that
route in under an hour?

1162
01:39:14,106 --> 01:39:15,950
They still have to climb
down to the middle terrace.

1163
01:39:16,001 --> 01:39:18,171
Well then, they need a new route.
A more direct route.

1164
01:39:29,569 --> 01:39:31,153
It's designed as a labyrinth.

1165
01:39:31,205 --> 01:39:33,780
There must be access where
we can cut through the maze, right?

1166
01:39:33,831 --> 01:39:35,491
Eames?

1167
01:39:57,587 --> 01:39:58,480
Did Eames add any features?

1168
01:39:58,532 --> 01:40:00,445
I don't think I should tell you.
If Mal finds out...

1169
01:40:00,497 --> 01:40:03,076
We don't have time for this.
Did he add any?

1170
01:40:03,129 --> 01:40:05,524
He added an air duct system
that can cut through the maze.

1171
01:40:05,576 --> 01:40:06,797
Good. Explain it to them.

1172
01:40:06,849 --> 01:40:08,352
- Saito?
- Go ahead.

1173
01:40:39,971 --> 01:40:42,078
Paradoxical.

1174
01:41:48,595 --> 01:41:51,443
- What was that?
- The kick.

1175
01:41:52,059 --> 01:41:54,935
- Cobb, did we miss it?
- Yeah, we missed it.

1176
01:41:54,946 --> 01:41:59,822
Couldn't you instead just have
dreamt of a goddamn beach?

1177
01:42:02,477 --> 01:42:04,568
What the hell do we do now?

1178
01:42:04,716 --> 01:42:06,770
We finish the job before the next kick.

1179
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,502
- What next kick?
- When the van hits the water.

1180
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:33,785
<i>If wanna make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

1181
01:42:33,836 --> 01:42:35,620
<i>If you need assistance...</i>

1182
01:42:35,671 --> 01:42:39,286
How do I drop you without gravity?

1183
01:42:41,386 --> 01:42:44,304
Arthur has a couple of minutes,
we have about twenty.

1184
01:43:06,685 --> 01:43:08,236
Are you okay?

1185
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:15,805
Move out!
To the base!

1186
01:43:20,062 --> 01:43:22,889
There's something wrong. They're heading
your way like they know something.

1187
01:43:24,753 --> 01:43:27,672
Just buy us some more time, alright?
Come on!

1188
01:43:28,107 --> 01:43:30,114
On my way.

1189
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:07,223
That's the antechamber,
it's just stronger.

1190
01:45:07,275 --> 01:45:08,693
Was it stronger if it have any windows?

1191
01:45:08,745 --> 01:45:10,171
No, I mean it wouldn't
be very strong if it did.

1192
01:45:10,222 --> 01:45:12,618
Let's hope Fischer likes
what he finds in there.

1193
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:16,115
Are those projections part
of his subconscious?

1194
01:45:16,358 --> 01:45:17,802
Yes.

1195
01:45:17,949 --> 01:45:19,337
Are you destroying
those parts of his mind?

1196
01:45:19,387 --> 01:45:21,474
No, no.
They're just projections.

1197
01:45:45,551 --> 01:45:46,969
We're here.

1198
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:50,125
You're clear but hurry.
There's an entire army headed your way.

1199
01:46:15,144 --> 01:46:16,847
We're in.

1200
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:06,634
- There's someone else in there.
- Fischer, it's a trap, get out!

1201
01:47:08,487 --> 01:47:10,482
Come on. A little lower.

1202
01:47:15,107 --> 01:47:21,193
- Cobb. No, she is not real!
- How do you know that?

1203
01:47:21,245 --> 01:47:24,996
She is just a projection.
Fischer...Fischer is real!

1204
01:47:28,841 --> 01:47:30,416
Hello.

1205
01:47:35,065 --> 01:47:38,161
Eames! Eames!
Get to the antechamber now!

1206
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,243
- What happened?
- Mal killed Fischer.

1207
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:27,036
I couldn't shoot her.

1208
01:48:27,184 --> 01:48:28,864
But there's no use in reviving him...

1209
01:48:28,916 --> 01:48:32,966
his mind's already trapped down there.
It's all over.

1210
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:35,492
So that's it?
Then we failed?

1211
01:48:35,543 --> 01:48:38,152
We're done.
I'm sorry.

1212
01:48:41,231 --> 01:48:44,563
Well, it's not me who's gonna
get back to my family, is it?

1213
01:48:44,805 --> 01:48:46,776
It's a shame, I really want to know
what's gonna happen in there.

1214
01:48:46,828 --> 01:48:50,110
- I swear we have this one..
- Let's set the charges.

1215
01:48:52,178 --> 01:48:54,214
No, there's still another way.

1216
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:56,924
We just have to follow
Fischer down there.

1217
01:48:56,974 --> 01:48:58,082
We don't have time.

1218
01:48:58,228 --> 01:49:01,708
No, but there will be enough
time down there.

1219
01:49:02,048 --> 01:49:03,190
And we will find him.

1220
01:49:03,242 --> 01:49:07,422
Okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in
just use the defibrillator to revive him.

1221
01:49:07,475 --> 01:49:11,044
We can give him his
own kick down below.

1222
01:49:11,096 --> 01:49:12,568
Look you get him in there.

1223
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:15,447
As soon as the music ends,
you blow up the hospital.

1224
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,638
And we all ride the kick
back up the layers.

1225
01:49:19,657 --> 01:49:21,176
That's worth a shot.

1226
01:49:21,228 --> 01:49:24,281
And Saito can hold the guards
out while I set the charges.

1227
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:26,647
Saito, will never make it, will he?

1228
01:49:27,454 --> 01:49:29,826
Cobb, come on!
We've got to try.

1229
01:49:29,974 --> 01:49:30,863
Let's go!

1230
01:49:31,202 --> 01:49:33,666
Look if we're not that fully kicked,
I am gonna leave in vain.

1231
01:49:33,718 --> 01:49:36,206
She's right.
She's right.

1232
01:49:41,197 --> 01:49:42,795
Can I trust you to do what's
gonna happen here?

1233
01:49:42,847 --> 01:49:44,426
I mean, Mal's gonna
be down there.

1234
01:49:44,477 --> 01:49:46,738
I know where to find her.
She'll have Fischer.

1235
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:48,460
How do you know?

1236
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:53,160
She wants me to come after her,
she wants me back down there with her.

1237
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:20,519
Are you alright?

1238
01:50:26,628 --> 01:50:29,313
- This is your world?
- Was.

1239
01:50:30,182 --> 01:50:32,044
This is where she'll be.

1240
01:50:32,802 --> 01:50:34,496
Come on.

1241
01:51:19,218 --> 01:51:21,416
Saito...

1242
01:51:21,467 --> 01:51:25,224
I need you...I need you to take care of
Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?

1243
01:51:25,277 --> 01:51:28,765
No room for tourists on this jobs.

1244
01:51:30,348 --> 01:51:32,942
Don't be silly.

1245
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,900
You built all these?
This is incredible.

1246
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:07,874
We built for years.

1247
01:52:08,884 --> 01:52:11,462
We started in on the memories.

1248
01:52:17,505 --> 01:52:19,103
This way.

1249
01:52:58,609 --> 01:53:02,696
This is our neighbourhood.
The place is from my past.

1250
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:07,259
That was our first apartment and we
moved to that building right there.

1251
01:53:07,502 --> 01:53:09,974
After Mal became pregnant,
that became our home.

1252
01:53:10,027 --> 01:53:12,800
You reconstructed all
of these from memory?

1253
01:53:12,949 --> 01:53:15,210
Like I told you, we have lots of time.

1254
01:53:15,262 --> 01:53:16,893
What is that?

1255
01:53:17,615 --> 01:53:20,096
It's the house Mal grew up with.

1256
01:53:20,148 --> 01:53:22,197
- Will she be in there?
- No.

1257
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,051
Come on.

1258
01:53:24,103 --> 01:53:27,226
We both wanted to live in a house
but we love this type of building.

1259
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:30,143
In the real world, we'd have
to choose, but not here.

1260
01:54:09,004 --> 01:54:11,315
How are you gonna bring Fischer back?

1261
01:54:11,365 --> 01:54:13,767
I'm gonna have to come up
with some kind of a kick.

1262
01:54:13,819 --> 01:54:15,532
What?

1263
01:54:15,966 --> 01:54:17,164
The improvised.

1264
01:54:17,312 --> 01:54:21,522
Listen, there's something you should know about me.
About inception.

1265
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,943
An idea is like a virus.
Resilient.

1266
01:54:38,905 --> 01:54:40,199
Highly contagious.

1267
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:43,842
The smallest seed of an idea can grow.

1268
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:49,561
It can grown to define or destroy you.

1269
01:54:52,061 --> 01:54:57,837
The smallest idea such as:
"Your world is not real".

1270
01:54:57,889 --> 01:55:01,719
Simple. little thought
that changes everything.

1271
01:55:02,463 --> 01:55:06,948
So certain of your world.
Of what's real?

1272
01:55:06,999 --> 01:55:09,632
Do you think he is?

1273
01:55:10,531 --> 01:55:14,213
Why do you think
he's as lost as I was?

1274
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:17,213
I know it's real, Mal.

1275
01:55:17,984 --> 01:55:20,567
No creeping doubts?

1276
01:55:20,714 --> 01:55:23,569
Not feeling persecuted, Dom?

1277
01:55:23,621 --> 01:55:27,424
Chased around the globe by anonymous
corporations and police forces?

1278
01:55:27,572 --> 01:55:31,032
The way the projections
persecute the dreamer?

1279
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:34,148
Admit it.

1280
01:55:34,294 --> 01:55:36,953
You don't believe in one reality anymore.

1281
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:41,305
So choose.
Choose to be here.

1282
01:55:41,644 --> 01:55:43,419
Choose me.

1283
01:56:08,016 --> 01:56:10,805
You know what I have to do,
I have to get back to our children...

1284
01:56:10,856 --> 01:56:12,849
because you left them.

1285
01:56:12,997 --> 01:56:15,651
- Because you left us.
- You're wrong.

1286
01:56:15,797 --> 01:56:18,597
- Not at all.
- You're confused.

1287
01:56:19,511 --> 01:56:21,733
Our children are here.

1288
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:25,234
And you'd like to see their
faces again, wouldn't you?

1289
01:56:25,287 --> 01:56:28,687
Yes, but I want to see
them up above, Mal.

1290
01:56:41,590 --> 01:56:44,071
Up above?

1291
01:56:44,123 --> 01:56:50,074
Listen to yourself.
These are our children. Watch.

1292
01:56:50,126 --> 01:56:52,294
James?
Phillipa?

1293
01:56:52,345 --> 01:56:54,720
Don't do this, Mal, please.
Those aren't my children.

1294
01:56:54,772 --> 01:56:57,156
You keep telling yourself
that but you don't believe it.

1295
01:56:57,208 --> 01:56:59,007
- No, I know it.
- What if you're wrong?

1296
01:56:59,059 --> 01:57:01,600
What if I'm what's real?

1297
01:57:02,552 --> 01:57:11,269
You keep telling yourself what you know.
But what do you believe? What do you feel?

1298
01:57:12,572 --> 01:57:14,491
Guilt.

1299
01:57:14,543 --> 01:57:17,624
I feel guilt, Mal.

1300
01:57:17,676 --> 01:57:21,565
And no matter what I do,
no matter how hopeless I am...

1301
01:57:21,617 --> 01:57:25,834
no matter how confused...
that guilt is always there.

1302
01:57:25,886 --> 01:57:28,577
reminding me of the truth.

1303
01:57:28,821 --> 01:57:31,728
What truth?

1304
01:57:32,591 --> 01:57:37,708
The idea that caused you to question
your reality came from me.

1305
01:57:40,756 --> 01:57:43,771
You planted the idea in my mind?

1306
01:57:44,733 --> 01:57:46,614
What is she talking about?

1307
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:52,436
The reason I knew inception was
possible was because I did it to her first.

1308
01:57:53,278 --> 01:57:56,405
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

1309
01:57:56,936 --> 01:57:58,991
We were lost in here.

1310
01:57:59,141 --> 01:58:03,606
I knew we needed to escape
but she wouldn't accept it.

1311
01:58:06,529 --> 01:58:12,690
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1312
01:58:12,741 --> 01:58:17,065
The truth that she had once
known but she chose to forget.

1313
01:58:17,662 --> 01:58:19,642
She couldn't break free.

1314
01:58:22,459 --> 01:58:24,914
So I decided to search for it.

1315
01:58:25,648 --> 01:58:30,379
Going deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1316
01:58:30,435 --> 01:58:35,467
I broke in and I planted an idea.

1317
01:58:35,519 --> 01:58:39,913
A simple idea that I knew
would change everything.

1318
01:58:44,384 --> 01:58:46,754
That her world wasn't real.

1319
01:58:58,615 --> 01:59:01,611
That death was the only escape.

1320
01:59:08,842 --> 01:59:10,877
You're waiting for a train..

1321
01:59:12,265 --> 01:59:14,992
A train that will take you far away...

1322
01:59:16,774 --> 01:59:19,361
You know where you hope
this train will take you.

1323
01:59:20,364 --> 01:59:22,499
But you can't know for sure!

1324
01:59:23,551 --> 01:59:25,474
And it doesn't matter!

1325
01:59:26,106 --> 01:59:29,840
- Now tell me why!
- Because we'll be together.

1326
01:59:33,461 --> 01:59:37,997
And I never knew that... that idea
would grow in her mind like a cancer...

1327
01:59:38,049 --> 01:59:41,799
that even after she woke.

1328
01:59:42,429 --> 01:59:46,832
... that even after yo
came back to reality

1329
01:59:47,519 --> 01:59:51,155
that you keep to believe
your world wasn't real.

1330
01:59:53,404 --> 01:59:56,196
That death was the only escape.

1331
01:59:56,348 --> 01:59:58,489
Mal, no!
Jesus!

1332
01:59:58,733 --> 02:00:02,287
- You're infecting my mind.
- I was trying to save you.

1333
02:00:02,338 --> 02:00:06,177
You betrayed me but you
can make amends.

1334
02:00:06,229 --> 02:00:08,119
You can still keep your promise.

1335
02:00:08,171 --> 02:00:13,939
We can still be together right here.
In the world we built together.

1336
02:01:30,886 --> 02:01:33,822
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.

1337
02:01:34,066 --> 02:01:36,265
You can't have him.

1338
02:01:36,413 --> 02:01:38,595
If I stay here, will you let him go?

1339
02:01:38,647 --> 02:01:41,017
What are you talking about?

1340
02:01:43,932 --> 02:01:46,404
Fischer's on the porch.

1341
02:01:46,456 --> 02:01:48,757
- Go check if he's alive, Ariadne.
- Cobb, you can't do this.

1342
02:01:48,809 --> 02:01:51,787
Go check if he's alive, right now!
Do it.

1343
02:02:06,509 --> 02:02:09,592
He's here and it's time
but you have to come now!

1344
02:02:09,645 --> 02:02:13,741
- Take Fischer with you, alright?
- You can't stay here to be with her!

1345
02:02:15,650 --> 02:02:18,474
I'm not. Saito's dead
by now that means...

1346
02:02:18,621 --> 02:02:22,393
he's down here somewhere.
That means I have to find him.

1347
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:26,779
I can't stay with her anymore
because she doesn't exist.

1348
02:02:26,830 --> 02:02:30,646
I'm the only thing you
do believe in anymore.

1349
02:02:32,369 --> 02:02:34,656
I wish...

1350
02:02:35,574 --> 02:02:38,661
I wish more than anything, but...

1351
02:02:38,905 --> 02:02:41,443
...I can't imagine you
with all your complexity.

1352
02:02:41,495 --> 02:02:43,551
All your perfection.
All your imperfection.

1353
02:02:45,307 --> 02:02:46,460
Are you alright?

1354
02:02:46,512 --> 02:02:49,084
Look at you.

1355
02:02:49,423 --> 02:02:54,482
You're just a shade.
You're just a shade of my real wife.

1356
02:02:54,533 --> 02:02:57,822
And you are the best
that I could do, but...

1357
02:02:57,874 --> 02:03:00,319
...I'm sorry, you're just
not good enough.

1358
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:02,480
This will feel real?

1359
02:03:04,138 --> 02:03:07,235
- What are you doing?
- Improvise.

1360
02:03:14,740 --> 02:03:16,409
No, no, no!

1361
02:03:17,361 --> 02:03:19,339
Get in there, now!
Go, go, go!

1362
02:04:03,904 --> 02:04:06,867
Disappointed...

1363
02:04:07,948 --> 02:04:09,091
Disappointed...

1364
02:04:09,143 --> 02:04:11,832
I know, Dad.

1365
02:04:17,192 --> 02:04:21,791
I know you were disappointed.
I couldn't be you.

1366
02:04:22,226 --> 02:04:25,728
No, no, no!...

1367
02:04:25,856 --> 02:04:33,191
I was disappointed that you tried.

1368
02:05:04,428 --> 02:05:06,316
Come on, come on, come on!

1369
02:05:14,302 --> 02:05:16,816
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

1370
02:05:29,093 --> 02:05:31,109
Dad?

1371
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:15,689
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1372
02:06:27,867 --> 02:06:31,263
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1373
02:06:31,409 --> 02:06:33,899
I will!

1374
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:14,287
Do you remember when
you asked me to marry you?

1375
02:07:14,627 --> 02:07:15,538
Yes.

1376
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:20,353
You said you dreamt that
we'll grow old together.

1377
02:07:20,901 --> 02:07:23,380
But we did.

1378
02:07:24,125 --> 02:07:27,322
We did, you don't remember?

1379
02:07:30,927 --> 02:07:34,392
I'd miss you, more
than I can bear, but...

1380
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:39,156
... we had our time together.

1381
02:07:39,216 --> 02:07:43,027
And I have to let you go.

1382
02:07:43,080 --> 02:07:46,365
I have to let you go.

1383
02:08:33,858 --> 02:08:35,663
I'm sorry, Robert.

1384
02:09:01,611 --> 02:09:05,191
You know, the Will means that
dad wanted me to be my own man.

1385
02:09:06,107 --> 02:09:08,872
Not just to live for him.

1386
02:09:09,740 --> 02:09:12,441
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1387
02:09:21,346 --> 02:09:23,098
What happened?

1388
02:09:23,150 --> 02:09:24,941
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1389
02:09:24,993 --> 02:09:28,034
No, to find Saito.

1390
02:09:28,469 --> 02:09:31,116
He'll be lost.

1391
02:09:32,347 --> 02:09:35,195
No, he'll be alright.

1392
02:09:49,681 --> 02:09:52,571
Are you going to kill me?

1393
02:09:55,371 --> 02:09:58,477
I'm waiting for someone.

1394
02:10:02,118 --> 02:10:06,241
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1395
02:10:07,237 --> 02:10:12,512
Cobb?
Impossible.

1396
02:10:12,914 --> 02:10:16,261
We were young men together.

1397
02:10:16,927 --> 02:10:19,955
I'm an old man...

1398
02:10:20,102 --> 02:10:23,863
Filled with regret.

1399
02:10:25,205 --> 02:10:28,873
Waiting to die alone, huh.

1400
02:10:30,966 --> 02:10:40,689
I've come back for you...
To remind you of something.

1401
02:10:42,894 --> 02:10:46,186
Something you once knew.

1402
02:10:48,049 --> 02:10:51,076
That this world is not real.

1403
02:10:54,830 --> 02:11:00,121
To convince me to
honor our arrangement?

1404
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:03,891
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1405
02:11:08,455 --> 02:11:16,269
Come back, so we can be
young man together again.

1406
02:11:19,019 --> 02:11:25,105
Come back with me.
Come back.

1407
02:11:34,767 --> 02:11:36,738
Hot towel, sir?

1408
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:39,785
We'll landing in Los Angeles
in about twenty minutes.

1409
02:11:39,836 --> 02:11:42,794
Do you need immigration forms?

1410
02:11:44,001 --> 02:11:45,724
Thank you.

1411
02:11:45,776 --> 02:11:48,721
- Hot towel, sir?
- Oh no.

1412
02:11:48,773 --> 02:11:50,662
Do you need immigration forms?

1413
02:12:59,469 --> 02:13:02,906
- Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.
- Thank you, sir.

1414
02:13:45,067 --> 02:13:48,318
Welcome home.
This way.

1415
02:14:08,261 --> 02:14:12,950
James?
Phillipa?

1416
02:14:15,632 --> 02:14:18,004
Look who's here!

1417
02:14:24,365 --> 02:14:27,424
Hey kids, how are you?

1418
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:30,356
- Daddy!
- How are you?

1419
02:14:30,503 --> 02:14:32,245
Look what I built, Daddy!

1420
02:14:32,297 --> 02:14:36,027
- What are you doing there?
- I built a house made of rocks!
